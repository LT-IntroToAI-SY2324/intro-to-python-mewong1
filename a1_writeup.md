# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.

## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
I think python might be a little easier to use than java in the long run. I think the syntax makes sense.



2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
Python seems a little more simple than java. The logic is the same but the syntax is different. This includes differences in sues of semi colons and colons, indents, etc. 



3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I learned how to use loops and if statements in python. I became more familiarized with the syntax and also refreshed some of my moding skills.
